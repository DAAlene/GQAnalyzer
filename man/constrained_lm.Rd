\usage{
constrained_lm(y, X, tol = 1e-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A column matrix with the y values}

\item{X}{The design matrix of the problem}

\item{tol}{A numeric value with the tolerance specified to avoid numerical instability
during the solution of the least-squares problem.}
}
\value{
This function returns a numeric vector with the values of the estimated coeffcicients.
}
\description{
Constrained least-squares function. The constraint included ensures that the sum of the
estimated coefficients is equal to 1 and the coefficients are positive.
