\usage{
m3_mixing_model(gdata, end.members)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdata}{A geochemical_dataset object with the major ions only.}

\item{end.members}{A geochemical_dataset with the chemical compositions of the
end-members of the solution.}
}
\value{
This function returns a list with the following entries:
\itemize{
\item mixing.ratios: Matrix with the mixing ratios estimated using constrained
least-squares.
\item res.pca: Object returned by the princomp function. This object contains the
eigenvectors, eigenvalues, scores and other results of the PCA.
\item res.lm: List with the results of the multiple linear regression applied on each
ion included in the gdata geochemical_dataset object. Each entry of this list is a lm
object for each ion.
\item names.lm: Character vector with the names of the ions used in the mixing analysis.
\item X:
\item dataset:
}

\description{
Function that implements the M3 mixing model. This model is based on the projection of
the chemical information in a low-dimensional space defined using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). The compositions of pre-defined end-members are also projected and from
these coordinates, the mixing ratios of each end-member are calculated using a constrained
least-squares procedure (mixing ratios add up to 1).
